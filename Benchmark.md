# Benchmark Report

This file will contain the results of running benchmarks on the entire algorithms_core library.

## How to Run Benchmarks

1. Ensure you have the `benchmark_harness` package in your `dev_dependencies` in `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     benchmark_harness: ^2.2.2
   ```
2. Run `dart pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Run the benchmark suite:
   ```sh
   dart run benchmark/benchmark.dart
   ```
